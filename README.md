# NP School of Engineering Website

This Final Year Project is done up by Jaymeson Koh, Nakagawa Miho Sherry, and Kugan S/O Elamaran of the class of 2021. Supervised by Mr Raymond Lam S.K. The code uses ReactJS as a base for development as well as using multiple dependencies such as react-router, react helmet, react-youtube, and react bootstrap. This site is built and optimized for GitHub Pages.

## Getting Started

Future students taking up the rich media interactive with Search Engine Optimization can hope to get started by forking the code or contacting blanklogic for the original source files.

### Prerequisites

```
Visual Studio Code
NodeJS
```

### Installing

After installing Visual Studio Code and NodeJS.

Get Started by creating your very own react project
```
npx create-react-app project-name
cd project-name
npm start
```

Install the necessary dependencies
```
npm install react-router-dom
npm install react-youtube
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
npm install --dev react-snap
npm install --save react-helmet
npm install --save react-icons
npm install node-sass
npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-react
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
```

## Running the tests

In order for us to develop efficiently and collaborate with each other, we utilized the following tools provided by ReactJS and NodeJS

### Localised Server Testing

In order to allow us to work flexibly at our own pace, a local server can be set up on our localhost using the following commands in the terminal with NodeJS
```
npm start
```

This allows us to be able to edit our website live while making changes on our code, viewing the final deployment as from the user's perspectives.

## Deployment

Files can be deployed efficiently and fast once settings have been done in package.json where the following is described
```
"homepage": "https://blanklogic.github.io/np-school-of-engineering/",
"name": "npsoeweb"
```

Thereafter, the following command can be utilized in the terminal with nodejs
```
npm run deploy
```
